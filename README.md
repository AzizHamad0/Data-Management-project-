# Book Dataset Management Project

This repository is home to a Python project designed for managing a dataset of books. It enables users to add, remove, and search for books, as well as sort the data based on different attributes. The project includes a user interface for easy interaction with the dataset, making it approachable for both programmers and non-programmers.

## Project Structure

- `google_books_dataset.csv` - A CSV file containing the dataset of books.
- `T109_P2_add_remove_search_dataset.py` - Handles adding, removing, and searching for books.
- `T109_P3_sorting_fun.py` - Implements sorting functions for the dataset.
- `T109_P4_booksUI.py` - The main user interface script for the application.
- `T109_P5_load_data.py` - Responsible for loading data from the CSV file.

## Features
